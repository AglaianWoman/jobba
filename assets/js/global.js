Though we have areas of specialty, we&#39;re also generalists and equally comfortable up and down the stack from writing SASS to optimizing SQL. We believe in an egoless approach to development and a blameless approach to problem solving. While we work independently, we support each other through frequent code and design reviews, daily stand-ups, and pair programming, facilitating learning and reducing friction in our regular release schedule of every 3 weeks.
