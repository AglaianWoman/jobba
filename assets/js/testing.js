In this role as a Full-Stack Developer at HelloSign you will help us scale our highly available eSignature platform and help us move to a service-oriented architecture. In addition to being highly skilled on the technical side, you should also be able to put yourself in the user&#39;s shoes and think critically about what you&#39;re building. We take pride in our work and want you to as well.</p>\n\n<p>Our team of 9 engineers is curious, driven, friendly, and collaborative. Though we have areas of specialty, we&#39;re also generalists and equally comfortable up and down the stack from writing SASS to optimizing SQL. We believe in an egoless approach to development and a blameless approach to problem solving. While we work independently, we support each other through frequent code and design reviews, daily stand-ups, and pair programming, facilitating learning and reducing friction in our regular release schedule of every 3 weeks. In addition to working with each other, we work cross-departmentally to promote transparency and share knowledge.</p>\n\n<p>Responsibilities:</p>\n\n<p>Develop our electronic signing API. We want to be the easiest way for developers to integrate eSignatures into their websites and apps.\nContinue to scale our system to support millions of users.Integrate our signed documents (PDFs) more deeply with Adobe&#39;s electronic signature SDK.\nContinue migrating our JavaScript to React and our CSS to SASS. We want our service to be fast, responsive, and mobile-friendly.\nWe work mostly in PHP (Symfony framework) but also believe in using the right tool for each particular job. Our stack also includes AWS, MySQL, ElasticSearch, Redis, Memcached, Beanstalkd (for worker queues), SASS, and React JS.</p>\n\n<p>Requirements:</p>\n\n<p>Experience: You’ve done web development for 4+ years (not a hard requirement) with an MVC-type framework. Bonus points for strong MySQL\nTeam work: You’re used to working collaboratively, participating in code reviews, and being a team player.\nProduct-centric: You love solving hard technical challenges and producing clean code, but you realize the product and the end-user’s experience is the most important thing. You need to care about the users and think beyond just the technical challenges.\nSelf-directed: We’re a startup. We need someone who is comfortable taking an imperfect feature specification and driving it all the way to completion.\nGood judgment: Ability to handle sensitive customer data.</p>\n\n<p>About Us:</p>\n\n<p>HelloSign is creating the next generation eSignature platform, with a focus on clean usability. We were recently voted #1 eSignature solution for Small Business and #1 software solution for Mid-Market business on G2 Crowd!
